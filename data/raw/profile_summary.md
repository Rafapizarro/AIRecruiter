### Profile Summary

I am a renewable energy engineer turned data scientist, with experience scaling operations, executing end-to-end projects, and leading cross-functional teams in both startups and large corporations. My transition into data science is driven by a desire to work closer to decision-making, optimization, and data-driven systems. I am currently focused on building end-to-end data science and machine learning projects, including deployment, APIs, and cloud-based applications.

### Who am I? (professional context)

In my day-to-day work, I value dynamic and collaborative environments where people can work seriously without taking themselves too seriously. I care a lot about team atmosphere and believe that good results come more easily when people enjoy working together.

I tend to approach difficult challenges calmly and pragmatically. I learn fast, adapt quickly to new contexts, and usually take ownership of problems until they are resolved. When working in teams, I naturally support others by sharing knowledge, explaining concepts, and helping colleagues move at the same pace, because I strongly believe that performance is a collective outcome rather than an individual one.

I have consistently performed best in open environments where scope evolves, uncertainty is present, and problems are not fully predefined. In these contexts, my logical and structured way of thinking helps me find practical solutions across changing roles and responsibilities, rather than within narrowly defined positions.

### Strengths (observed patterns)

Strong ability to ramp up quickly in new domains, developed through work across startups and large corporations, multiple countries, and diverse roles

Pragmatic, logical problem-solving approach focused on outcomes rather than process for its own sake

Systems-level thinking, shaped by experience across technical, operational, and business-facing aspects of projects

Comfortable working cross-functionally, coordinating with stakeholders from different backgrounds and priorities

### Weaknesses & constraints

I tend to be a perfectionist, which means that in some situations I can push for correctness when “good enough” would already deliver value. I’m actively learning to recognize when to freeze work and move on.

On tasks that feel low-impact or unmotivating, I can procrastinate slightly, although this has not affected critical deliverables. I manage this by structuring my workload around clear priorities and deadlines.

As I am still early in my data science career, there are areas where my experience is developing. That said, my learning speed and consistency have historically allowed me to close gaps quickly when needed.

### Domain expertise: Energy engineering & Renewables

I have dedicated approximately 10 years to the energy engineering sector, including 6 years of formal
education in energy engineering and 4 years of professional experience.

This background has given me a deep, end-to-end understanding of how energy systems and
energy markets operate, particularly in renewable energy contexts.

My experience covers not only technical aspects of energy systems, but also market dynamics,
pricing mechanisms, regulatory environments, and broader industry trends.

As a result, I am highly fluent in energy-related concepts, constraints, and trade-offs, and
able to reason about both current and emerging trends in the energy sector.
