I am a renewable energy engineer turned data scientist, with experience scaling operations, executing end-to-end projects, and leading cross-functional teams in both startups and large corporations. My transition into data science is driven by the desire to work closer to decision-making, optimization, and data-driven systems. I am currently focused on building end-to-end data science and machine learning projects, including deployment, APIs, and cloud-based applications.
