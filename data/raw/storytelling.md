### Professional Trajectory
I have always had a logical and analytical mindset, and combined with a strong interest in nature, this led me to start my career in renewable energy engineering. My studies did not focus only on technical aspects, but also on business strategy and decision-making.

After entering the workforce, I progressed quickly toward roles with higher responsibility, managing projects, teams, and stakeholders across startups and large corporations. These experiences exposed me to complex operational systems and required me to adapt quickly to new environments and constraints.

Across these roles, a consistent pattern became clear: I was most effective in dynamic, fast-moving settings where technical understanding, execution, and strategic decision-making had to come together, and where I could take ownership of processes and outcomes rather than work on isolated tasks.

### Motivation for Transition to Data Science
After leading teams and delivering increasingly complex engineering projects, I reached a point where the next steps in my career were clear but not motivating. Progression meant broader scope and hierarchy, but the nature of the work itself remained largely the same: execution, coordination, and delivery.

At the same time, the learning curve in my day-to-day role began to flatten. I had developed a deep understanding of the technical landscape I was operating in, and new projects increasingly felt like variations of known problems rather than opportunities to think differently. What I was missing was the ability to step back, analyze situations from first principles, and make decisions based on evidence, trade-offs, and expected outcomes.

Data science offered that shift. It placed the focus on reasoning before action: understanding why things behave as they do, testing assumptions, and choosing directions based on data rather than precedent. I pursued this transition not as a rejection of engineering, but as a way to move closer to the decision-making layer, where continuous learning and analytical thinking are central to the work itself.

### How Engineering Shapes My Data Science Approach
My engineering background has shaped a strongly problem-driven way of thinking. I am used to starting from a concrete problem, identifying constraints and trade-offs, and working toward solutions that hold under real-world conditions. This naturally carries into how I approach data science and machine learning.

Because of my training in mathematics, probability, and statistics, I tend to focus not only on model outputs, but on what happens under the hood: the assumptions being made, the behavior of the model under different conditions, and the implications of those choices for decision-making. This allows me to build models with a clear understanding of why a given approach is appropriate, rather than treating modeling as a black box.

Engineering also required me to learn complex systems quickly and adapt to new technologies and domains. That experience translates directly into data science, where continuous learning and critical evaluation of methods are essential to building reliable and meaningful solutions.

### What I am working on
After completing my data science training, I deliberately chose to reinforce my foundations by becoming a teacher at Le Wagon. Teaching machine learning, data processing, and cloud deployment forced me to deeply understand what is going on under the hood, and what the problem we are trying to solve needs and why.
By helping students debug pipelines, structure projects, and reason through modeling and deployment decisions, I consolidated core data science fundamentals and developed a clear mental framework for building end-to-end solutions rather than isolated notebooks.

At the same time, this experience made one gap very clear: while I was comfortable with modeling and experimentation, I wanted to strengthen my ability to design production-ready systems.

And that is why I am now intentionally building end-to-end data science and machine learning projects that emphasize deployment, structure, and real-world usability. My work focuses on:
- Designing reproducible data pipelines
- Building APIs and lightweight user interfaces
- Containerizing applications with Docker
- Deploying models and services to cloud environments

Rather than optimizing for isolated metrics, I am building systems that are robust, explainable, and usable by non-technical stakeholders.
This portfolio work is designed to demonstrate not just that I can train models, but that I understand how data products are structured, deployed, and maintained in real environments — and how they create value once they leave experimentation.

### What I’m Looking For & How I Create Value
I perform best in environments where problems are real, constraints exist, and outcomes matter. I am most effective in teams that value clarity of thinking, ownership, and execution over titles or rigid hierarchies.

I bring the most value when I can work end-to-end: understanding a problem, structuring data, designing a solution, and turning it into something usable. I am comfortable moving between technical work and higher-level reasoning, and I naturally take responsibility for the quality and impact of what I build.
I thrive in teams that are:
- product- or impact-driven rather than purely research-focused
- open to discussion, feedback, and iteration
- pragmatic about tools and decisions
- focused on learning and improving systems over time

I am particularly motivated by roles where data science is used to support decisions, optimize processes, or improve real-world outcomes, rather than as an isolated academic exercise.
In return, I bring:
- strong problem-structuring and analytical thinking
- the ability to learn fast and adapt to new domains
- reliability under pressure and ownership of results
- a mindset focused on building things that work, not just models that score well
