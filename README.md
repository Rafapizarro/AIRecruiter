# Rafa Recruiter Assistant

An AI-powered recruiter assistant that evaluates how well Rafa López Pizarro fits a given job description using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Problem
Recruiters spend significant time manually assessing candidate–job fit, often relying on subjective judgment and incomplete information.

## Solution
This project builds a RAG-based system that:
- Ingests Rafa’s professional profile
- Accepts job descriptions as input
- Produces grounded, explainable fit analyses
- Highlights strengths, alignment, and gaps honestly

## Status
🚧 Work in progress — Week 1: Foundation
